/// Each `HasRelationship` stores an erased closure of how it eager loads it's values. Unfortunately
/// it's difficult to persist this closure as `Model`s are decoded from the database. This class
/// is a cache of relationship names -> eager load closures, so they can be properly associated when
/// the `Model` is decoded.
///
/// There needs to be a better way of doing this because of the weird implementation details leaking
/// out (unique id for each has relationship), thread safety issues (all event loops need to access
/// this object, etc). Some options are...
/// 1. Keep eager loading behavior in the property wrapper & figure out how to initialize a generic
///    Model without decoding (so the data in the property wrapper is available), then pull it with
///    the KeyPaths passed to `.with(...)` when eager loading.
/// 2. Remove eager loading behavior from the property wrapper initializer. Instead have each
///    relationship type have default assumed eager load behavior but give the user the option to
///    have custom behavior in a `static var eagerLoadingBehavior: [KeyPath: EagerLoadBehavior]` on
///    the Model.
///
/// 1 would be best, since the behavior should be tied to the relationship, but I don't think it
/// will be possible to initialize without losing the info in the default propertyWrapper
/// initializer, so 2 will likely need to be the way moving forward.
