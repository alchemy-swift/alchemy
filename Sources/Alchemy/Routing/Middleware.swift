/// A `Middleware` is used to intercept either incoming `Request`s or
/// outgoing `Response`s. Using futures, they can do something
/// with those, either synchronously or asynchronously.
///
/// Usage:
/// ```
/// // Example synchronous middleware
/// struct SyncMiddleware: Middleware {
///     func intercept(_ request: Request, next: @escaping Next) throws -> EventLoopFuture<Response>
///         ... // Do something with `request`.
///         // Then continue the chain. Could hook into this future to
///         // do something with the `Response`.
///         return next(request)
///     }
/// }
///
/// // Example asynchronous middleware
/// struct AsyncMiddleware: Middleware {
///     func intercept(_ request: Request, next: @escaping Next) throws -> EventLoopFuture<Response>
///         // Run some async operation
///         Services.db
///             .runRawQuery(...)
///             .flatMap { someData in
///                 // Set some data on the request for access in
///                 // subsequent Middleware or request handlers.
///                 // See `HTTPRequst.set` for more detail.
///                 request.set(someData)
///                 return next(request)
///             }
///     }
/// }
/// ```
