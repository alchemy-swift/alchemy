## Installation

### Quickstart

The Alchemy CLI can help you get started with one of the [Quickstart](Quickstarts/) templates. It is installable with [Mint](https://github.com/yonaskolb/Mint).

```shell
mint install joshuawright11/alchemy-cli@main
```

You'll be guided through picking a new project template, either `Backend` or `Fullstack`.

```shell
alchemy new <ProjectName>
```

### Swift Package Manager

Alchemy is also installable through the [Swift Package Manager](https://github.com/apple/swift-package-manager).

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/joshuawright11/alchemy", .branch("main"))
    ...
],
targets: [
    .target(name: "MySwiftServer", dependencies: [
        .product(name: "Alchemy", package: "alchemy"),
    ]),
]
```

## Documentation

### [Docs](Docs/)

The Docs provide a step by step walkthrough of everything Alchemy has to offer as well as essential core backend concepts for developers new to server side development.

**Note**: If something is confusing or difficult to understand please let us know on [Discord](https://discord.gg/Dnhh4yJe)!

### [Quickstarts](/Quickstarts)

If you'd rather just jump into reading some code, the projects in `Quickstarts/` are contrived apps for the purpose of showing working, documented examples of everything Alchemy can do. You can clone them with `alchemy new` or browse through their code on github.

### [API Reference](https://github.com/joshuawright11/alchemy/wiki)

The inline comments are extensive and full of examples. You can check it out in the codebase or a generated version on the [Github wiki](https://github.com/joshuawright11/alchemy/wiki).

## Why Alchemy?

Alchemy is designed to make your development experience...

- **Smooth**. Elegant syntax, 100% documentation, and extensive guides touching on every feature. Alchemy is designed to help you build backends faster, not get in the way.
- **Simple**. Context-switch less by writing full stack Swift. Keep the codebase simple with all your iOS, server, and shared code in a single Xcode workspace.
- **Rapid**. Quickly develop full stack features, end to end. Write less code by using supporting libraries ([Papyrus](Docs/4_Papyrus.md), [Fusion](Docs/2_Fusion.md)) to shared code & providing type safety between your server & Swift clients.
- **Safe**. Swift is built for safety. Its typing, optionals, value semantics and error handling are leveraged throughout Alchemy to help protect you against thread safety issues, nil values and unexpected program state.
- **Swifty**. Concise, expressive APIs built with the best parts of Swift.

## Roadmap

Our top priorities right now are:

0. Conversion of async APIs from `EventLoopFuture` to [async/await](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0296-async-await.md) as soon as it's released.
1. Filling in missing core server pieces. Particularly,
    - `HTTP/2` support
    - `SSL`/`TLS` support
    - Built in support for `multipart/form-data` & `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`
2. Persistent, queued jobs backed by Redis / Memcached.

## Contributing
