# Alchemy

Alchemy is a Swift web framework for building the backend of your next project. It offers...

- [x] Elegant, Swifty APIs for all the things you need to build a backend including REST Routing, Jobs & Schedulers, Database access, a QueryBuilder & ORM, and much more
- [x] A CLI & libraries built around facilitating shared code between your server & iOS clients. Write less code & rapidly develop full stack features, end to end.
- [x] Extensive documentation, guides and tutorials to keep you focused on building your project.

## Getting Started

### CLI

The Alchemy CLI is jam packed with features to kickstart and accelerate development. We recommend using this to get your project going.

### Manually

If you prefer not to use `alchemy new`, you can clone one of our sample projects here & build off that.

If you'd prefer a completely clean slate, you can start by creating a new package project in xcode & adding `Alchemy` as a dependency via the Swift Package Manager.
