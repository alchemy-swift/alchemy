# Onboarding & Knowledge
To make the onboarding & dev process smooth AF, there should be amazing resources for people to get started & learn more.

### Documentation
Great docs, probably with refs to the related tutorials when applicable. Ideally with intro's to server concepts since the initial target audience will probably be curious client devs. 

### Tutorials
Spitballing...
- di & services
- deploying heroku, DO, GCP, AWS
- database models
- migrations
- what event loops to be using, multithreading, request event loops
- simple routing
- redis
- queues
- making external API requests
- microservices
- running commands, when to run them
- websockets
- web dev, geared @ ios folks that are web noobs

### Classes like https://laracasts.com/
Avenue for monetization. 

### (?) Sample Project
A constantly updated "best practices" project to show off a ton of features & their implementation. Give devs a feel for what their code might look like.

### Support
Strong focus on StackOverflow. Maybe a shared chat for questions? Dunno if that would be shooting the proj in the foot
by detracting from SO answers. Vapor only has 572 Qs after nearly 4 years... https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/vapor
