# Tooling
Tooling makes the dev experience more production ready and I bet there's a lot of potential for unique tooling leveraging
mobile client & server shared code. Probably the best avenue for income as well.

Spitballing...
- this is amazing https://github.com/laravel/telescope
- easy remote logging for client & server. Sidenote: this is complex but would be interesting to have something that would let you look @ client & server logs associated with the same user @ the same time.
- cli that lets you add a shared & server target to your existing xcode project
- easy paid deployment like https://forge.laravel.com/
