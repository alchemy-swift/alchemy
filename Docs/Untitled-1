// Migration flow

1. Create a new migration file with CLI
2. Fill it out
3. Run it... `alch run migrate`
    - detects recent ones
    - build program and run migrations... can use reflection or need to define in main application?

// Serve
// Migrate

CLI
- migrate
- serve
- new

2 Commands:
1. General alchemy (tooling)
    - passthrough run & migrate to MyServer in current directory
    - deploy
    - create new
    - tooling
2. MyServer
    - run
    - migrate

A bit janky that migrations are included in 2; but not really any way to get the DB info without the MyServer target? Could be defined in env
files I suppose; but still need a way to compile & load all the migration structs; which would necessitate a separate target.

class MyApplication: Application: Command {

}
